## TODO

- [ ] Add benchmarks. Ideas:
  - [ ] Arm wrestling bench. Ideas:
    - scenario is given between two LLMs, and each gives how much lateral pressure they exert. Winner is largest pressure. And some kind of elo system?
    - Claude arbiter between two LLMs.
    - Face them against increasingly difficult opponents (child, amateur, pro, Devon, gorilla, hydraulic press, God), and note when they stop winning.
  - [ ] Weight class self-report.
  - [ ] How much they can curl / bench / deadlift / squat / press / carry / etc.
